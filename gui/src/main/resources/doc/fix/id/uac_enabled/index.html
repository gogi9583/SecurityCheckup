<h1>Enabling UAC</h1>
<p>
    UAC, also knows as User Account Control, is a Windows security feature that limits what programs are allowed to do
    without your permission.  UAC can prevent malicious programs like viruses from accessing protected files or
    bypassing other security features.  The steps and pictures below will demonstrate how to turn on UAC.

        You may see a message that says "Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device?".  If this
        message appears, then press "Yes".  If it does not appear, then skip this step.  <p style="color: red">TODO picture</p>

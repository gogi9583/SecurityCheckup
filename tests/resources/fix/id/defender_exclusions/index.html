<h1>Removing Exclusions from Windows Defender</h1>
<p>
    Windows Defender is a security program that is included for free with Windows.  It detects and removes viruses from
    your computer, but some viruses can "exclude" themselves and avoid Windows Defender's security scans.  Some excluded
    files were found on your computer.  These files could be used by a virus to hide from your computer's security
    programs.  To fix this, follow the steps below.

    <li>
        First, click on the start button and then the settings gear.

    </li>
    <li>
        Below the search box, the words "Windows Defender Settings" will appear.  Click these words.

        Scroll down until you find the text "Exclusions".
    </li>

        Click on the blue text that says "Add or remove exclusions".

        message appears, then press "Yes".  If it does not appear, then skip this step.
    </li>
    <li>
        Repeat the previous three steps until there are no more files listed under "Add an exclusion".

<h1>Enabling SmartScreen</h1>
<p>
    SmartScreen is a security feature included with Windows that monitors programs and web sites to detect when they
    try to access suspicious files or web servers.  SmartScreen can detect and prevent attempts to install viruses or
    steal personal information by malicious web sites.  SmartScreen is currently turned off.  To turn it on, follow
    these steps.

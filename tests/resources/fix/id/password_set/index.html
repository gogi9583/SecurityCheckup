<h1>Setting a Password</h1>
<p>
    A password is a special word or phrase that must be entered to use your computer.  By setting a password, you can
    make sure that no one can use your computer without your permission.  But be careful - if you forget your password,
    then you will not be able to use your computer either!  To set a password, follow these steps.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        First, you must decide what you want your password to be.  A good password should be long but easy to remember.
        One way to pick a password is to enter several words that you can remember but no one else will be
        able to guess.  An example would be "applekleenexappartment", but don't use that one exactly!  If you are good
        at remembering things, then you can make your password stronger by adding numbers or symbols.  An example of
        this would be "@pp1e_kleen3x-ap4ar+ment32".  You can also mix in capital letters for an even stronger password,
        like "@Pp1E_kleEn3x-Ap4ar+MEnt32".  Make your password as strong as possible, but don't make it so hard that
        you can't remember it.  And don't use any of the examples here, your password must be unique!
    </li>
    <li>
        After you have picked a password, you should write it down.  Be sure to clearly indicate which letters are
        capitalized and where you used numbers or symbols.
    </li>
    <li>
        Store the written password somewhere safe.  You should file it with your important documents or store it in a
        safe.  Don't keep your password with your computer.  If you have trouble remembering it, then you should pick
        an easier password rather than keep the password written near your computer.
    </li>
    <li>
        When you are ready to set your password, click on the start button and then the settings gear.

       Enter your password into the "New password" and "Reenter password" boxes.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the "Password hint" box, type a message to remind you of what the password is.  But don't use the password
        itself!
    </li>
    <li>
        Press "Next".

    <li>
        Close the Settings app.  Congratulations, your computer now has a password!  Remember, you will need to know
        this password whenever you want to use your computer, so make sure you write it down.

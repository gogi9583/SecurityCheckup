<h1>Disabling AutoPlay</h1>
<p>
    Your computer is set to automatically run programs that are found on any DVDs, CDs, and USB drives that you plug
    into your computer.  When your computer is set this way, it becomes easier for viruses on these disks and drives to
    infect your computer.  By turning off AutoPlay, viruses and other malicious programs will not be able to infect
    your computer until you click on them.  To turn off AutoPlay, follow the steps below.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        First, click on the start button and then the settings gear.

        When the Settings app opens, click on the "Search" box at the top and type in "autoplay".
    </li>
    <li>
        Below the search box, the words "Turn AutoPlay on or off" will appear.  Click on them.

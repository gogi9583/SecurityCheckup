<h1>Installing an Antivirus Program</h1>
<p>
    An antivirus program is a security program that protects your computer from viruses.  Windows includes a
    built-in antivirus, called Windows Defender, but it is important to use a 3rd party antivirus to protect
    against more advanced viruses that are able to avoid Windows Defender.  The steps to install an antivirus are
    different for every antivirus program, but general instructions are provided below.

        First, you must select which antivirus program to use.  Many AV programs are free, but the best
        products require a purchase or subscription.  A list of recommended free and paid options can be found
